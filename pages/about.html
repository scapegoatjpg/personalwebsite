                <h3>Hey there! I'm Laura Longoria, a Prairie View A&M Graduate, Computer Science.
                    Currently, I work at Heights High School in HISD, where I am a dedicated substitute
                    for the school. I basically take over a classroom that needs a substitute to cover 
                    for the teacher. I utilize instructions left from the teacher and have students do
                    assignments in a controlled manner. My biggest responsibility in this job is teaching 
                    the AP Computer Science Principles course in the school, which is the main reason I am 
                    currently just a dedicated substitute. I am on track in completing my alternative 
                    teaching certification through Texas Teachers of Tomorrow, and will become the official
                    Computer Science teacher for Heights High School. With assistance from the TEALS program, 
                    we will be helping these students succeed their AP exam by creating fast paced yet 
                    understandable lesson plans to compensate for the missed instructions from the previous 
                    teacher.<br/>
                    A little more about myself, I spent all four years and graduated at PVAMU with Magnum Cum Laude status, 
                    cummulative GPA of 3.84. I am a transgender woman, I hope you are alright and accepting 
                    of that!<br/><br/>
                    I also try to keep myself busy with some personal projects, such as: keeping up with my personal website,
                    planning out and assembling my own custom smart mirror that I plan to add facial recognition with specific profiles,
                    and as of now my main focus is with game development, creating my own 2D fantasy RPG game.
