                <h3>Hey there! I'm Laura Longoria, a Prairie View A&M Graduate in Computer Science.
                    Currently, I work at Klein Oak High School in Klein ISD, where I am a Computer Science
                    teacher for the school. I teach from the very basics of programming to more advanced concepts,
                    data structures and algorithms. I also teach the foundations of cybersecurity and basic ethical
                    hacking skills. I use Java, Python, C++, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, and Game Maker in my classroom to teach about the 
                    many branches of Computer Science. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    A little more about myself, I spent all four years and graduated at PVAMU with Magnum Cum Laude status, 
                    cummulative GPA of 3.84 out of 4.0. I am a transgender woman, I hope you are alright and accepting 
                    of that! I also try to keep myself busy with some personal projects.
