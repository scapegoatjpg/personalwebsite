                <h3>Hey there! I'm Laura Longoria, a Prairie View A&M Graduate, Computer Science.
                    Currently, I work for CSAT Solutions LP, where I diagnose, troubleshoot, repair, 
                    and test different MacBook models. I am still currently seeking for a full-time 
                    job opportunity that could put my knowledge and skills in programming to good use.<br/>
                    A little more about myself, I spent all four years and graduated at PVAMU with Magnum Cum Laude status, 
                    cummulative GPA of 3.84. I am a transgender woman, I hope you are alright and accepting 
                    of that!<br/><br/>
                    I also try to keep myself busy with some personal projects, such as: keeping up with my personal website,
                    planning out and assembling my own custom smart mirror that I plan to add facial recognition with specific profiles,
                    and as of now my main focus is with game development, creating my own 2D fantasy RPG game.
